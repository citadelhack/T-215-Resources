# Purpose
This file contains resources for learning about binary exploitation.

## Books
### [Hacking: The Art of Exploitation 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441/ref=asc_df_1593271441/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312140868236&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8450791586386966275&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010488&hvtargid=pla-406163955993&psc=1&mcid=197883de44b83886b1bc06e014023fb2&gclid=CjwKCAiA8YyuBhBSEiwA5R3-EwZIOcXy9kRLb8mbZSeQCZBOhhMHqDPhRt8YZlnllraX-QdET-shVRoCg3oQAvD_BwE)
This book is a must read when getting started with binex. It walks you through the basics of C and x86 assemble before getting into reverse engineering, and basic buffer overflows as well as other basic memory corruption based attacks.

## Websites
### [Binary Exploitation Notes](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/)
This gitbook by ir0nstone is a great resource for learning about different memory structures, mitigation techniques, and attacks with simiple examples.

## Challenges
### [Pwnable.kr](https://pwnable.kr)
Pwnable.kr is a website hosting binex challenges sorted by difficulty. Not a great place to start but a great place to practice and find weak points and attacks you don't know. Write-ups for each challenge can be found online, don't be afraid to learn from a write-up if you get stuck.

## Write-up Repos
### [Nightmare](https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/nightmare)
The Nighmare repository is a repository of challenges and write-ups involving reverse engineering and binex. A good place to start practicing. 

## Youtube Channels
### [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN)
LiveOverflow is a great youtuber for learning about hacking and exploitation, but he also has an outstanding playlist walking you through binary exploitation and memory corruption attacks.
