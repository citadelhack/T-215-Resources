# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to be a one stop shop for citadel students who want to study and practice different computer science and cyber topics outside of class. 
This is currently a work in progress. If you have anything you would like to be added or changed suggest a commit or notify me on the T215 discord.

# Organization
For now I will just be organizing these sources by topics into different .md files.  Each file will contain URLs along with a breif description of the resource. So just click on the file with the topic you want to learn about and start researching!
Happy Hacking!

# Future Plans
Besides updating and improving organization, I may begin adding write-ups from myself and other members of the Citadel Cyberteam so that everyone can learn from our failures and successes.

### Stuff to research and add:
global /etc/ld.so.preload that will overwrite functions in the global namespace(SUID binaries included), so you can't pin it to a specific process like you can with LD_PRELOAD
