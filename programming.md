# Purpose
To catalog resources for learning different programming languages and different algorithms, as well as resources for interview practice.

## Websites
### [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
W3Schools contains guides for almost any language you could want to learn, including query languages like SQL and specific guides on popular libraries and frameworks like numpy(python) and React(javascript).

### [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
Geeks for Geeks is a learning platform similar to W3Schools with guides on many programming languages. However, it has fewer guides on specific libraries and more guides on specific data structures and algorithms.

### [Reading Cdecls](http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/reading-cdecl.html)
This is a great article explaining how to read complicated declarations in C.

### [Bootlin Elixir Cross-Referencer](https://elixir.bootlin.com)
This is a versioned sourcecode repository/search engine for many linux things (glibc, musl-libc, u-boot, linux kernel, zen kernel, and more).

### [grep.app](https://grep.app/)
Grep.app is a source code search engine covering about 500,000 git repositories. It is a great tool when learning a new language or library.

## Challenges
### [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
LeetCode is the industry standard for practicing for coding interviews. Even easy problems can be difficult for the beginner, so don't get disheartened and remember that other people's solutions are a great resource after you have given a challenge your best shot.

### [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)
Exercism is another platform similar to LeetCode but with challenges tailored to specific languages and a shallower learning curve.
